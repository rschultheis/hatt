# This file defines which services are available to interact with
# 
# Additionally, one may define any arbitrary configuration in here as well
# the appid is an example of that
#
# For this example, services which offer free APIs were chosen.
# This example will show how the APIs can be called individually.
# This example will show how to combine calls to APIs to accomplish higher level tasks.
#
# FreeGoIP is a free IP that requires no authentication
#
# Open Weather Map is a free API, however it does require a basic form of authentication
#
hatt_services:
  # Freegoip - get IP and Geolocation data (City) of requester
  freegeoip:
    # All that is needed in the most basic case is a base URL to the API
    url: 'http://freegeoip.net'

  # Open Weather Map (owm) - allow getting basic weather data (current temperature, high/low etc)
  owm:
    url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org'
    # This appid is added to get requests as a query parameter.  
    # This is how owm handles authentication for their API
    # See the hattdsl file for how this appid is used
    # To override this a couple options:
    # a) simply change the value in this file to a valid one
    # b) create a hatt.secret.yml file and override only this value in it
    # c) use an environment variable: env 'HATT_services-owm-appid'='my_app_id'
    # d) make your own way of doing it in hattdsl methods
    appid: 'YOU MUST OVERRIDE WITH YOUR APP ID'
